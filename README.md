# -Comprehensive-Database-Management-System-using-MySQL

Introduction
This project demonstrates the creation of a comprehensive database management system for a hypothetical online bookstore using MySQL. The system includes schema design and normalization, implementation of complex SQL queries and stored procedures, and security and backup measures.

Schema Design and Normalization
The database schema was designed to store essential information about books, authors, customers, orders, and order details. By normalizing the schema to 3NF, data redundancy was minimized, and data integrity was maintained.

Complex SQL Queries and Stored Procedures
Complex SQL queries and stored procedures were implemented to handle various data retrieval and manipulation tasks efficiently. These included retrieving books by author, calculating total sales for customers, adding new books, and calculating author sales.

Database Security and Backup
To ensure data security, user roles and privileges were configured, and sensitive data encryption was implemented. Regular backups were scheduled using cron jobs to prevent data loss and ensure data recovery in case of system failures.

Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates the creation of a robust and secure database management system using MySQL. The designed schema, along with the implemented queries, stored procedures, and security measures, ensures efficient data storage, manipulation, and protection.
